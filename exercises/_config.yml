# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

Learn how to attack and defend Kubernetes, Linux and containers from Jay Beale, the creator of Bastille Linux and two Kubernetes security tools: the Peirates attack tool and the Bust-a-Kube CTF cluster. In this fully hands-on course, you'll get a laptop to keep, filled with capture-the-flag (CTF) machines, Kubernetes clusters, and containers, which you will attack and defend. Youâ€™ll also get access to our cloud environment, allowing you to attack cloud-based Kubernetes clusters.
