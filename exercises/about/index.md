## Overview

Learn how to attack and defend Kubernetes, Linux and containers from Jay Beale, the creator of Bastille Linux, the Center for Internet Security's first Linux security benchmark, and two Kubernetes tools: the Peirates attack tool and the Bust-a-Kube CTF cluster. In this fully hands-on course, you'll get a laptop to keep, filled with capture-the-flag (CTF) machines, Kubernetes clusters, and containers, which you will attack and defend. You’ll also get access to our cloud environment, allowing you to attack cloud-based Kubernetes clusters.

This training focuses on giving you practical attack skills from real penetration tests, coupled with solid defenses to break attacks. Every single topic in the class has a long attack exercise, where you use Kali Linux to compromise a system, and a matching short defense exercise, where you will use new skills to break that attack, confident that it will break other attacks. In this well-reviewed class, we attack the container orchestration system, Kubernetes, along with the Linux operating system and containers that make it up!

We start the class without any passwords for the laptops - in the first exercise, you break into your laptop! Then we use Metasploit to break into the first vulnerable program with a network exploit and learn how to break that exploit. Next, we move into privilege escalation attacks, learning how to move from a restricted shell with non-root privilege in a container into full unrestricted root access in that container. Again, we learn how to break that attack. We move on to breaking out of containers into the host, and using the host to take control of the Kubernetes cluster and the cloud environment. We also use containers/pods to attack the Kubernetes control plane and the cloud APIs. By the time we're through, you will have compromised at least 15 CTF scenarios. You will also have broken attacks hands-on with AppArmor, SecComp, and the latest in container and Kubernetes security controls.

Our Kubernetes work will include: authorization settings, role-based access control, network policies and service meshes, pod security standards, and admission controllers like Kyverno and OPA Gatekeeper. These will enable and enforce the powerful technologies we’ve learned: AppArmor, SecComp, SELinux, root capability dropping, and filesystem controls. We’ll see how both on-prem and cloud-based clusters can be attacked, attack our own clusters, and then harden those Kubernetes clusters to break our attacks.

We will cover each of the following, with exercises in both attack and defense:

- Cloud Native Attack and Defense
- Attacking Public Cloud Services (AWS and GCP)
- Advanced Privilege Escalation, including via Linux Capabilities and Namespaces
- Network, Server and Web Application Attacks
- Privilege Escalation, including container breakout
- Container Breakout and Kubernetes Node Attacks
- Container Profile Enforcement with AppArmor, Syscall, and Capability Restriction
- Monitoring and Active Response
- Ingresses with ModSecurity WAF functionality
- Web server and proxy hardening, including Nginx
- Server Application Attack and Defense, including NoSQL databases
- Docker/Container Run-time Attack and Defense
- Kubernetes Cluster Attacks
- Defeating and Defending Multi-tenant Clusters
- Kubernetes RBAC – Attack and Defense
- Attack and Assessment tools: Peirates, kube-hunter and kube-bench
- Kubernetes Secrets Abuse and Protection – Attack and Defense
- Kubernetes Network Segmentation and Service Meshes
- Kubernetes Admission Control: Kyverno, OPA Gatekeeper, etc.
- Container Breakout and Kubernetes Node Attacks
- Attacking Public Cloud Environments to Compromise Kubernetes


## Trainers

Jay Beale works on Kubernetes and cloud native security, both as a professional threat actor and in his open source work. He's the architect of the Peirates attack tool for Kubernetes & the @Bustakube CTF cluster. He created Bastille Linux and the CIS Linux scoring tool, used by hundreds of thousands. Since 2000, he has led training classes on Linux & Kubernetes security at the Black Hat, RSA, CanSecWest and IDG confs. An author and speaker, Beale has contributed to nine books, two columns and over 100 public talks. He is a co-founder and CTO of the infosec consulting company InGuardians.
